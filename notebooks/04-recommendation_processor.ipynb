This twenty-eight-year-old may have a checkered past littered with romantic mistakes, excessive drinking, and creative vandalism; she may be addicted to Get Smart reruns and prefer entering homes through windows rather than doors -- but the upshot is she\\'s good at her job as a licensed private investigator with her family\\'s firm, Spellman Investigations. Invading people\\'s privacy comes naturally to Izzy. In fact, it comes naturally to all the Spellmans. If only they could leave their work at the office. To be a Spellman is to snoop on a Spellman; tail a Spellman; dig up dirt on, blackmail, and wiretap a Spellman. <br /><br />Part Nancy Drew, part Dirty Harry, Izzy walks an indistinguishable line between Spellman family member and Spellman employee. Duties include: completing assignments from the bosses, aka Mom and Dad (preferably without scrutiny); appeasing her chronically perfect lawyer brother (often under duress); setting an example for her fourteen-year-old sister, Rae (who\\'s become addicted to \"recreational surveillance\"); and tracking down her uncle (who randomly disappears on benders dubbed \"Lost Weekends\"). <br /><br />But when Izzy\\'s parents hire Rae to follow her (for the purpose of ascertaining the identity of Izzy\\'s new boyfriend), Izzy snaps and decides that the only way she will ever be normal is if she gets out of the family business. But there\\'s a hitch: she must take one last job before they\\'ll let her go -- a fifteen-year-old, ice-cold missing person case.

Thus, when studied by this method, the congruence is in reality defined by its relation to two surfaces. Important results of the Kummer theory are the existence of the two focal surfaces and of two one-parameter families of developables. These results have been used by Wilczynski as the basis of his general projective theory of congruences. In the present paper also, the focal surfaces will be regarded as known by means of a parametric representation, such that the ruled surfaces u = const, and v = const, of the congruence are its developables. <br />The first section is devoted to the introduction of certain local coordinate systems, all closely related to the general line of the congruence. These coordinate systems are used to study the properties of the congruence in the neighborhood of one of its lines, as well as the properties of its Laplacian transforms. Homogeneous cartesian coordinates are introduced in the second section and the equations (D) of the Wilczynski theory are derived.'}, {'category': 'popular', 'title': 'Daily Life of the Ancient Egyptians (The Greenwood Press Daily Life Through History Series)', 'description': \"Explore the daily lives of ancient Egyptians in this exciting new update of one of the most successful Daily Life titles.

Nondenominational organizations like Campus Crusade account for much of modern evangelicalism\\'s dynamism and adaptation to mainstream American culture. Despite the importance of these \"parachurch\" organizations, says John Turner, historians have largely ignored them.<br /><br />Turner offers an accessible and colorful history of Campus Crusade and its founder, Bill Bright, whose marketing and fund-raising acumen transformed the organization into an international evangelical empire. Drawing on archival materials and more than one hundred interviews, Turner challenges the dominant narrative of the secularization of higher education, demonstrating how Campus Crusade helped reestablish evangelical Christianity as a visible subculture on American campuses. Beyond the campus, Bright expanded evangelicalism\\'s influence in the worlds of business and politics. As Turner demonstrates, the story of Campus Crusade reflects the halting movement of evangelicalism into mainstream American society: its awkward marriage with conservative politics, its hesitancy over gender roles and sexuality, and its growing affluence.'}, {'category': 'popular', 'title': 'Morality After Auschwitz: The Radical Challenge of the Nazi Ethic', 'description': 'Preface<br />Introduction<br />The Intellectual Matrix of an Ethic<br />The Growth of an Ethic<br />Ethics &amp; the Shaping of Social Institutions<br />Responding to an Ethic: The Loss of Evil<br />Afterwards: The Holocaust &amp; Us<br />Notes<br />Index<br />Acknowledgments'}, {'category': 'popular', 'title': 'Lilith', 'description': \"First Ballantine Adult Fantasy Edition, 1969<br /><br />'<i>Lilith</i> is equal if not superior to the best of Poe' Wrote W.H Auden in his introduction to the 1954 reprint of George MacDonald's <i>Lilith</i>, first published in 1895.<br /><br />It is the story of Mr. Vane, an orphan and heir to a large house - a house in which he has a vision that leads him through a large old mirror into another world.

Symptom management, personal care, and administering of medications are just some of the tasks taken on by this group of non-professionals, and the impact of this role can have negative emotional, physical, financial and social implications on the care-giver. Furthermore, family carers consistently report unmet needs, and there has been a lack of intervention studies aimed at improving carer support. <br />This book therefore provides an evidence-based, practical guide to enable health and social care professionals to assess and respond to family carer needs.

      "[{'category': 'popular', 'title': 'The Reasons of Love', 'description': \"This beautifully written book by one of the world's leading moral philosophers argues that the key to a fulfilled life is to pursue wholeheartedly what one cares about, that love is the most authoritative form of caring, and that the purest form of love is, in a complicated way, self-love.<br /><br /><br /> Harry Frankfurt writes that it is through caring that we infuse the world with meaning. Caring provides us with stable ambitions and concerns; it shapes the framework of aims and interests within which we lead our lives. The most basic and essential question for a person to raise about the conduct of his or her life is not what he or she should care about but what, in fact, he or she cannot help caring about.<br /><br /><br /> The most important form of caring, Frankfurt writes, is love, a nonvoluntary, disinterested concern for the flourishing of what is loved. Love is so important because meaningful practical reasoning must be grounded in ends that we do not seek only to attain other ends, and because it is in loving that we become bound to final ends desired for their own sakes.<br /><br /><br /> Frankfurt argues that the purest form of love is self-love. This sounds perverse, but self-love--as distinct from self-indulgence--is at heart a disinterested concern for whatever it is that the person loves. The most elementary form of self-love is nothing more than the desire of a person to love. Insofar as this is true, self-love is simply a commitment to finding meaning in our lives.\"}, {'category': 'popular', 'title': 'Early Greek Myth: A Guide to Literary and Artistic Sources, Volume 2', 'description': '<i>Early Greek Myth</i> is a much-needed handbook for scholars and others interested in the literary and artistic sources of archaic Greek myths—and the only one of its kind available in English.

His book successfully captures a singular moment in American history, when the biker lifestyle was 1st defined, &amp; when such countercultural movements were electrifying &amp; horrifying America. Thompson, the creator of Gonzo journalism, writes with his usual bravado, energy &amp; brutal honesty, &amp; with a nuanced &amp; incisive eye; as The New Yorker pointed out, \"For all its uninhibited &amp; sardonic humor, Thompson\\'s book is a thoughtful piece of work.\" As illuminating now as when originally published in \\'67, Hell\\'s Angels is a gripping portrait, the best account we have of the truth behind an American legend.', 'user_id': '1'}, {'category': 'recommended', 'title': 'Talking Heads', 'description': 'Talking Heads is a series of dramatic monologues written for BBC television by British playwright Alan Bennett and later published as a series of books.', 'user_id': '2'}, {'category': 'recommended', 'title': 'A Question of Proof (Nigel Strangeways, #1)', 'description': 'The faculty and student body at Sudeley are shocked but scarcely saddened when the headmaster’s obnoxious nephew, Algernon Wyvern-Wemyss, is found dead in a haystack on Sports Day. <br /><br />But when the young English master, Michael Evans, becomes a suspect in the case, he’s greatly relieved when his clever friend Nigel Strangeways, who is beginning to make a name for himself as a private inquiry agent, shows up to lend a hand to the local constabulary. <br /><br />Strangeways immediately wins over the students and even becomes an initiate in one of their secret societies, The Black Spot, whose members provide him with some of the information he needs to solve the case. <br /><br />In the meantime Michael and Hero Vale, the pretty young wife of the headmaster, continue their hopeless love affair.

With <em>Backlash</em> in 1991, Susan Faludi broke new ground when she put her finger directly on the problem bedeviling women, and the light of recognition dawned on millions of her readers: what\\'s making women miserable isn\\'t something they\\'re doing to themselves in the name of independence. It\\'s something our society is doing to women. The book was nothing less than a landmark. Now in <em>Stiffed,</em> the author turns her attention to the masculinity crisis plaguing our culture at the end of the \\'90s, an era of massive layoffs, \"Angry White Male\" politics, and Million Man marches. As much as the culture wants to proclaim that men are made miserable--or brutal or violent or irresponsible--by their inner nature and their hormones, Faludi finds that even in the world they supposedly own and run, men are at the mercy of cultural forces that disfigure their lives and destroy their chance at happiness. As traditional masculinity continues to collapse, the once-valued male attributes of craft, loyalty, and social utility are no longer honored, much less rewarded. Faludi\\'s journey through the modern masculine landscape takes her into the lives of individual men whose accounts reveal the heart of the male dilemma. <em>Stiffed</em> brings us into the world of industrial workers, sports fans, combat veterans, evangelical husbands, militiamen, astronauts, and troubled \"bad\" boys--whose sense that they\\'ve lost their skills, jobs, civic roles, wives, teams, and a secure future is only one symptom of a larger and historic betrayal.', 'user_id': '10'}]\n",

Kendall recounts the ups and downs of servanthood. Learn the lessons that Kendall learned, who has been impacted by the ministry and friendship of spiritual giants like Billy Graham, Arthur Blessitt, Paul Cain, John Arnott, Randy Clark, Rodney Howard-Browne, and many others. \"RT had high and holy hopes when he came to tackle London. I admired his courage and his perseverance, and I valued the times we spent together.\" -John R.W. Stott, Rector Emeritus, All Souls Church, Langham Place, London, England<br /><br /><b>About the author: </b><br /><br />R.T. Kendall, was the pastor of Westminster Chapel in London, England, for twenty-five years. Born in Ashland, Kentucky, he was educated at Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and Oxford University. He is well known internationally as a speaker and teacher. Dr. Kendall is the author of more than forty books, including The Word and the Spirit, The Sensitivity of the Spirit, The Anointing: Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow; and Total Forgiveness. His writings have impacted and changed thousands of lives worldwide.', 'user_id': '8'}, {'category': 'recommended', 'title': 'His Own Words: Translation and Analysis of the Writings of Dr. Ayman Al Zawahiri', 'description': 'Al Qaeda second in command Dr. Ayman Zawahiri is often referred to as the \"brains of Al Qaeda.\" This book translates into English the writings of Zawahiri, as well as the post-September 11 communiques of the Egyptian physician turned terrorist. It includes a complete translation of his December 2001 book \"Knights Under the Prophet\\'s Banner.\" If you want to know what makes this Al Qaeda leader tick, this is the book to read.', 'user_id': '9'}, {'category': 'recommended', 'title': 'Doing Time on the Outside: Deconstructing the Benevolent Community', 'description': \"Criminalized women are the focus of great interest in contemporary sociological research all over the world, however much of the growing body of work in this area has focused on the prison. Considerably less attention has been paid to women serving their sentences in the community.<em>Doing Time on the Outside</em> fills a gap in the research by focusing on the experiences of women on conditional release, and attempting to understand how some criminalized women avoid going back into custody given the many challenges they face.<br /><br />Using data collected in a series of interviews, MaDonna R. Maidment identifies four major factors characterizing women's attempts at re-integration. First, the fewer 'layers of social control' a woman lived under prior to her prison term, the greater her chances of staying out of prison. Those women accustomed to a lifetime of formal social controls are vulnerable and largely dependent on continued intervention. Second, women's own accounts of their success do not coincide with official definitions. For many women who have spent their lives being controlled by state agencies, managing a relatively short period of independence in the community marks a major milestone. Third, for those women who have managed to stay out of the criminal justice system, a majority remain tightly entangled in other state-sponsored control regimes, where patterns of dependency, medicalization, and infantilization still persist in the treatment of women. Fourth and finally, familial and social support networks are paramount to women's successful re-integration, far more so than professional supports provided by state and community agencies. Maidment's important findings have significant implications: they beg us to re-examine how our society processes criminalized women, and to call into question well-entrenched contemporary policies, which have failed to account for the economic, social, and cultural realities of women's lives.\", 'user_id': '10'}]\n",
